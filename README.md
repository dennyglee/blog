### dennyglee tech blog

Hi there, I am developer advocate at Databricks, long-time contributor to Apache Sparkâ„¢ and MLflow, Delta Lake maintainer, and long-time Seattle-ite.  In my past life, I was part of Microsoft Engineering for SQL Server, Cosmos DB, Bing, and part of the Project Isotope incubation team that brought Apache Hadoop into Microsoft.  

The following posts, links, and assets are in reverse chronlogical order.  Some posts were originally on my wordpress site but have been moved over to GitHub, blemishes and all, for posterity.

> This blog is inspired by [Frank McSherry's musings](https://github.com/frankmcsherry/blog) which I highly recommend you follow
